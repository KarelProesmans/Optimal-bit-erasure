This repository contains the code used to generate results for the manuscripts 'Optimal finite-time bit erasure under full control' and 'Finite-time Landauer principle' by K. Proesmans, J. Ehrich and J. Bechhoefer. 

In particular, the available version of the code returns the data used to create figure 6 of 'Optimal finite-time bit erasure under full control'.

The code uses the Mersenne Twister package.
